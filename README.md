# Hall_Yarborough_Z_factor
A simple Z-factor calculator for real gases was built using python to calculate the compressibility 
factor of real gases by solving the Hall-Yarborough equation using the Newton-Raphson iterative technique. 
The program takes as input: 
  temperature (in Fahrenheit), 
  pressure (in psia), 
  gas specific gravity, and
  the mole fractions of each nonhydrocarbon component (N2, CO2, H2S).
A windows executable file (.exe) was also packaged which can be downloaded and used direccctly without installing any other packages
